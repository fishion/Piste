* scripts for fcgi, modPHP, cgi etc
* fix all print_r, error_log, die for consistency
Notice that Catalyst takes "extra slash-separated information" from the
       URL and passes it as arguments in @_ (as long as the number of
       arguments is not "fixed" using an attribute like :Args(0)).

Controllers
-----------
* Private methods are not controller actions
* "Local" is default and means namespace/method - Default so maybe not needed.
* "Global" attribute means don't use namespace as root path - Don't think this is needed
* "Path" is all powerful - by default it uses package namespace, but prefix with '/' for global
* "Regex" & "LocalRegex" - useful
* "Chained" needs 'PathPart' (just Path?) 'CaptureArgs'/'Args'

There are five types of "special" built-in :Private actions: begin (before), end (after), default (fallback), index, and auto.

Default template
----------------
Default template is always the 'local' name of the last part of the chain. Not sure about when you set 'Path'...


Scripts to create projects
--------------------------

must create

* public/index.php
* lib/AppName.php
* lib/AppName/Controller
* lib/AppName/Model
* lib/AppName/View

might create
* Default HTML view
* default wrapper?
* some kind of tests
