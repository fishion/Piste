* Params as well as args
* test JSON response switching (should work)
* Properly capture all dependencies of Piste
    * PEARify all the dependencies and use the PEAR installed ones in apache
    Logger, Testsimple, probably most of them.
* scripts for CGI, mod_PHP, php_fpm, fcgi, etc
    * Also, run own lightweight http server for development?
* cookies
* scripts to create projects
* Might want to be able to detach & call other Controller methods. If so, will need to be able to define non-dispatch-endpoint methods. They'd probably be protected methods, accessed indirectly through the $pc object.

* grep all TODO (across all php_packages)
* Documentation (across all php_packages)
* Sort out PEAR packaging and installation of all PHP packages
