* Move Piste/Piste to Piste/lib/Piste (and same for all php packages)
* Simpletest and Compass_mechanize dependencies for testing
    * test JSON response switching (should work)
* scripts for fcgi, modPHP, cgi etc
    * Also, run own lightweight http server for development?
* Models
* cookies
* scripts to create projects
* fix all print_r, error_log, die for consistency

* grep all TODO (across all php_packages)
* Documentation (across all php_packages)
* Sort out PEAR packaging and installation of all PHP packages

* Might want to be able to detach & call other Controller methods. If so, will need to be able to define non-dispatch-endpoint methods. They'd probably be protected methods, accessed indirectly through the $pc object.

Scripts to create projects
--------------------------

must create

* public/index.php
* lib/AppName.php
* lib/AppName/Controller
* lib/AppName/Model
* lib/AppName/View
* scripts for use with modPHP, FastCGI etc.
* scripts to start/stop application?

might create
* Default HTML view
* default wrapper?
* some kind of tests
